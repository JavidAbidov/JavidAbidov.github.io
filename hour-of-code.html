                The “Hour of Code” is an online programming course designed to introduce the basics of coding. It is
                more than just an online course; it serves as an invitation for students of all ages to explore coding
                fundamentals in a fun, accessible, and engaging way. Our team was thrilled to bring this experience to
                life by hosting an Hour of Code event specifically tailored for 5th-grade students across 140 schools.
                This initiative included both beginners in programming and those with some prior experience.

                We aimed to create an environment where students could actively engage, learn, collaborate, and support
                each other as they delved into programming concepts. This large-scale event provided an excellent
                opportunity to observe how 5th graders perceived coding concepts, the challenges they encountered, and
                the progress they made throughout the experience. By reaching so many schools, we hoped to inspire young
                learners to develop curiosity and confidence in programming.

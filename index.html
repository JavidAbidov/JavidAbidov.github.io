            <h1>Welcome to Team Lazy!</h1>
            <p>
                We’re not just lazy, we’re strategically relaxed! Team Lazy is a group of creative thinkers, efficient
                problem-solvers,
                and innovation enthusiasts who believe in working smarter, not harder.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the name may suggest otherwise, we take pride in delivering results with minimal effort and
                maximum impact.
                Whether it’s coding, designing, or brainstorming the next big idea, we know how to balance work and play
                to keep things fun and productive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Join us on our journey to prove that sometimes, being “Lazy” can lead to ingenious solutions and
                unforgettable achievements.
                Because in the end, laziness is just the art of conserving energy for what truly matters.

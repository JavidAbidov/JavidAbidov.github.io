            <b>The Website Project</b> is our third team assignment for the Principles of Information Systems course. In
            this project, we utilized and combined our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional,
            interactive, and visually appealing website.

            <br><br>

            <b>HTML</b> (HyperText Markup Language) serves as the backbone of any website, allowing us to define the
            structure and organize content through elements like headings, paragraphs, links, tables, and forms. It
            ensures that the information on the website is properly displayed in a logical format.

            <br><br>

            <b>CSS</b> (Cascading Style Sheets) is responsible for the presentation and design of the website. It
            enabled us to control layout, colors, fonts, and overall styling, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing
            user experience. By using advanced CSS features, such as media queries, we also made the website responsive
            across different devices.

            <br><br>

            <b>JavaScript</b>, a versatile programming language, added interactivity and dynamic functionality to the
            project. It allowed us to implement features such as form validation, interactive buttons, animations, and
            event-driven elements. JavaScript provided the tools to make the website not only functional but also
            engaging for users.

            <br><br>

            One of our biggest challenges was coordinating as a team with different schedules, which we overcame through
            regular meetings and task division. We also faced technical issues with pull-push operations, fixing code
            errors, ensuring browser compatibility, and aligning design with content. Despite these challenges, teamwork
            and persistence helped us create a website we are proud of, providing invaluable hands-on experience in
            coding, problem-solving, and web development.

            <br><br>

            In conclusion, we could not have completed this project without the support of the online courses provided
            by Codecademy, where we learned everything we know about website development. These courses equipped us with
            the foundational knowledge and practical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling us to successfully
            bring our ideas to life in this project.
